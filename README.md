Summarizing Wikipedia Outline Pages

This utility will take in an outline wikipedia page, for example [Outline of Finance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_finance_topics), and output a summary of "Finance" by taking each of the first paragraphs of the links referenced on the finance page.


This will be able to make use of topics listed on [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Outlines) page.
